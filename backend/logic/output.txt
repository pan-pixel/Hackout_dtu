Amit Mudgill   Updated Nov 03, 2023, 1:35 PM IST                                  Zomato may report 57 per cent YoY jump in net sales at Rs 2,607 crore, Kotak Institutional Equities said. This brokerage expects Ebitda at Rs 9.9 crore.    
Shares of Zomato Ltd climbed nearly 5 per cent in Friday's trade ahead of teh food aggregator's September quarter earnings. The stock rose 4.83 per cent to hit a high of Rs 112.70 on BSE, with a total of 28.55 lakh Zomato shares changing hands so far compared with a two-week average of 34.63 lakh shares.

JM Financial in its preview note expected Zomato's revenue growth to be higher than its gross order value or (GOV) growth at 19.1 per cent amid an improvement in take-rates. The domestic brokerage is expecting the contribution margin to come in at 6.8 per cent of average order value (AOV) compared with 6.4 per cent in Q1, with the assumption that the improvement will be purely take-rate driven. Adjusted Ebitda margin expansion, it said, could be limited to 30 basis points sequentially, thanks to salary hikes in July. 

"In BlinkIt, we expect very strong sequential GOV growth of 17 epr cent led by robust increase in order. We also expect take-rates to improve to 19.3 per cent from 17.9 per cent in Q1, driven by ad income - that in turn should help the company achieve contribution level profitability for the very fir[0m

Amit Mudgill   Updated Nov 03, 2023, 1:35 PM IST                                  Zomato may report 57 per cent YoY jump in net sales at Rs 2,607 crore, Kotak Institutional Equities said. This brokerage expects Ebitda at Rs 9.9 crore.    
Shares of Zomato Ltd climbed nearly 5 per cent in Friday's trade ahead of teh food aggregator's September quarter earnings. The stock rose 4.83 per cent to hit a high of Rs 112.70 on BSE, with a total of 28.55 lakh Zomato shares changing hands so far compared with a two-week average of 34.63 lakh shares.

JM Financial in its preview note expected Zomato's revenue growth to be higher than its gross order value or (GOV) growth at 19.1 per cent amid an improvement in take-rates. The domestic brokerage is expecting the contribution margin to come in at 6.8 per cent of average order value (AOV) compared with 6.4 per cent in Q1, with the assumption that the improvement will be purely take-rate driven. Adjusted Ebitda margin expansion, it said, could be limited to 30 basis points sequentially, thanks to salary hikes in July. 

"In BlinkIt, we expect very strong sequential GOV growth of 17 epr cent led by robust increase in order. We also expect take-rates to improve to 19.3 per cent from 17.9 per cent in Q1, driven by ad income - that in turn should help the company achieve contribution level profitability for the very fir[0m
